I recently completed a project utilizing OpenCV to perform essential image processing tasks.
This project involved:

Image Detection: Implemented robust image detection techniques to identify and capture specific image features.
Image Blurring: Applied various blurring techniques to control focus and reduce noise, enhancing the visual quality for specific use cases.
Image Resizing: Created dynamic resizing functions to adjust image dimensions while preserving aspect ratios, optimizing images for different applications.
This project demonstrated the versatility of OpenCV for handling a wide range of image processing tasks, providing practical tools for applications in digital media, security, and machine vision.
